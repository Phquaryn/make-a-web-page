<h3>The World Wide Web is made up of documents, mostly html, linked together</h3>

	<p class = "iceCreamRaspberry">The first major piece of the web is actually three pieces: you, your computer and the browser. Simply, you go to a page with your computer using a browser. The Internet is made up of different types of documents, but the main type is HTML, or HyperText Markup Language documents. The links between the 30 Billion html and other documents are what make the web "web-like". Other major pieces of the web are http protocol and the servers.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Use a consistantly styled HTML document coupled with CSS to create a well structured page</h3>
<div id = "boxMint" class = "boxMint">
	<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/BnUu2ePt.png" alt= "Creative Commons by mura.org, used under CC / resized from original">
	<p class = "iceCreamMint">HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. HTML controls the tree-like structure of a page, or "DOM" (Document Object Model). Per Wikipedia, "A tree structure... is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in graphical form" and is "generally upside down compared to an actual tree".
    <br> Like HTML, CSS is a language.  "Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language." CSS controls the style of a page. The tutorial touches on the Chrome Dev Tools to check out/play with CSS elements and the office hours q&amp;a goes into using it in more depth. avoiding repitition with CSS</p>

<h3>The Internet is made up of boxes - remember this when creating html page layouts</h3>

	<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/up2gfORt.png" alt="Creative Commons by thestudentroom.co.uk, used under CC / resized from original">
	<p class = "iceCreamCookie">Elements on a web page are all boxes. Boxes are easy to relocate. Name your tags something descriptive too help keep your boxes organized, like class ="screenshot" or div class = "title" (or delicious ice cream flavors, to help you choose and organize colors for a random color scheme.).</p>

<h2>Stage 2</h2>
	<h3>Intro to Computer Science</h3>
	<div id = "boxTopic" class = "boxTopic">
		<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/ffLNfLSt.png" alt="Creative Commons by thelunacafe.com, used under CC / resized from original">
		<p class = "cottonTopic">
		Important topics: Breaking problems into smaller pieces, computers, computer programs, the web "a link is a special kind of text in a web page". Important terms: computer, program, precise sequence of steps, computation, high-level language, input, interpreter.
		A computer is a "universal machine" that can do anything. A program tells the computer what to do. A program "is a precise sequence of steps". A computer can execute bilions of steps in one second. Python is an interpreter. "The programs you'll write in this class will be Python code. Those will be input to another program which is a Python interpreter that follows the instructions in your code and it does that by following the instruction in its code... and you'll be able to run all that using your web browser."

	<h3>Computer Programming vs Computer Science</h3>
	<div id = "boxComp" class = "boxComp">
		<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/jYRLKfJt.png" alt="Creative Commons by bakingdom.com, used under CC / resized from original">
		<p class = "appleComp">Why don't we use English to program computers? Ambiguity and Verbosity: we need a language with concrete definitions (for example, the word "biweekly" means both two weeks AND twice a week - if we say 'biweekly', how would a computer know what that means?). The answer is, we need something more sussinct for complicated ideas. Backus-Naur form: non-terminal -> replacement grammar, Derivation

	<h3>Variables and Strings in Python</h3>
			<div id = "Rainbow0" class = "boxRainbow">
		<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/atunvqRt.png" alt="Creative Commons by https://s-	media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/84/ca/1b/84ca1b0dcb2fccb2238669c50642a7ae.jpg , used under CC / resized from original">
		 <p class = "iceCreamRainbow">Variables:
		 <br><br>A Python variable is a way to use a names to keep track of stored values. You name or label a number or a "string" of characters. 
		 <br><br>Lets look at assigning a variable to a number. Why would you do that? When we create our code, we might understand why we are using the number 1.21. But, if we assign the number an expression to describe it like this: 1.21 = gigawattsBackToTheFuture , the next person to read our code will understand its meaning, too.  We could further clarify it with a comment that is readable by humans but not read by the interpreter or compiler. In python it would be preceded by the pound sign.
		 <br><br>As the name implies, this variable can change, or vary. So if, in the future, the technology improves you may be able to propell yourself at gigawattsBackToTheFuture = gigawattsBackToTheFuture - 0.5, telling is that we need merely 0.71 gigawats to power our future-Delorean.
		 <br><br>But variables aren't just integers. A string is a sequence of characters contained in quotation marks.	One use of a string could be to create reusable text on your webpage. greeting = "Hello" just pop print greeting wherever you want to repeat the text "Hello" on your webpage.
		 <br><br>Q: What is the difference btwn 2+2 and "2"+"2"? A: 2+2 are numbers (integers), "2"+"2" are strings, and you cannot add them.
		 <br><br>You can index string, or find the position of something in a string using "find". Ask Python to find the e in the word 'test' like this:'test'.find('e') and you might think it will return the number 2, because to us the 'e' is the second letter. In fact, the computer is counting from zero, so it will return a 1. If you ask Python to find the q in the word 'test' like this:'test'.find('q'), it will return a -1, to let you know that letter doesn't exist in that string.
		<br><br>You can also index strings using square brackets. If we have a database with date of birth formatted like this: 01012001, and we wanted to pull just the year, we could assign the dob a variable like this: dob = '01012001' and then print just the year using square brackets like this: print dob[4:] Putting the 4 in front of the colon tells it to start at position four and leaving the other side of the colon blank tells it to run to the end. If you wanted to print just the month you would use print dob[0:2]. If I wanted to make sure my selection will work even if the dob format changes, I could use dob[-4:]. So even if my date format in my database changes to 01-Jan-2001, I will still get the last four digits and still capture the year as my result.

	<h3>Functions in Python</h3>
			<div id = "Rainbow1" class = "boxRainbow">
		<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/atunvqRt.png" alt="Creative Commons by https://s-	media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/84/ca/1b/84ca1b0dcb2fccb2238669c50642a7ae.jpg , used under CC / resized from original">
		 <p class = "iceCreamRainbow">Functions:
		<br><br> A function has inputs (like the cameras showing the car the surroundings in the video) and outputs (both the 3D model and the self-driving car not hitting walls, other cars, pedestrians). In python, we can write a fuction like: 'def say_hello(name):' In this example, 'name' is a parameter or an input. We would tell our function name is 'Bob' by typing say_hello('Bob')The output would be whatever our function returns.
		
		<br><br>def helloGurl(name):
		<br>string = 'Hello ' + name
		<br>
		<br>print helloGurl('Mary')
		<br>We've written our function, but will it work? It has all the pieces we need, 'def' to tell python the function has started, first line ending with a colon, the next line is indented properly, and we're printing the result after adding our string to our function, right? Wrong! This won't work because our function never returns anything. If we ran this, we would get an unexpected result. In this case instead of the 'Hello Mary' we are hoping for, it would return 'None'.
		<br><br>Simply adding return string as the third line of code (properly indented) and our function is in business.
		<br><br>Procedures or functions can also be built-into Python. '.find' is a built-in procedure. This is useful because whenever we need to use .find to identify something in a string, we have the ability to do this. When we write our own functions, we give ourselves the ability to do something anywhere in the project without rewriting history each time.

	<h3>Procedural Thinking: step by step problem solving, "create and follow clear, ordered plans"</h3>
	<div id = "Rainbow2" class = "boxRainbow">
		<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/atunvqRt.png" alt="Creative Commons by https://s-	media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/84/ca/1b/84ca1b0dcb2fccb2238669c50642a7ae.jpg , used under CC / resized from original">
		<p class = "iceCreamRainbow">Procedural Thinking: step by step problem solving, "create and follow clear, ordered plans" 
		<br><br>Use single, double, or triple quotes so you can easily nest strings. 
		<br><br>Try to use code that will still work, even if you change something (like with the negative-indexing example.) . General versus specific solutions.
		<br><br>Making decisions - which code to use. Boolean values are true or false.
		<br><br>Loops - can count for you, can do something that would be tedious by hand (like remove spaces from a sentance) - for - while - break
		<br><br>Debugging -bugs are an inevitable part of programming -a mental model of figuring out what works will help you figure out what isn't working
