	<p class = "iceCreamRaspberry">The first major piece of the web is actually three pieces: you, your computer and the browser. Simply, you go to a page with your computer using a browser. The Internet is made up of different types of documents, but the main type is HTML, or HyperText Markup Language documents. The links between the 30 Billion html and other documents are what make the web "web-like". Other major pieces of the web are http protocol and the servers.</p>

<h2>Use a consistantly styled HTML document coupled with CSS to create a well structured page</h2>
<div id = "boxMint" class = "boxMint">
	<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/BnUu2ePt.png" alt= "Creative Commons by mura.org, used under CC / resized from original">
	<p class = "iceCreamMint">HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. HTML controls the tree-like structure of a page, or "DOM" (Document Object Model). Per Wikipedia, "A tree structure... is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in graphical form" and is "generally upside down compared to an actual tree".
    <br> Like HTML, CSS is a language.  "Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language." CSS controls the style of a page. The tutorial touches on the Chrome Dev Tools to check out/play with CSS elements and the office hours q&a goes into using it in more depth. avoiding repitition with CSS</p>

<h2>The Internet is made up of boxes - remember this when creating html page layouts</h2>
<div id = "boxCookie" class = "boxCookie">
	<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/up2gfORt.png" alt="Creative Commons by thestudentroom.co.uk, used under CC / resized from original">
	<p class = "iceCreamCookie">Elements on a web page are all boxes. Boxes are easy to relocate. Name your tags something descriptive too help keep your boxes organized, like class ="screenshot" or div class = "title" (or delicious ice cream flavors, to help you choose and organize colors for a random color scheme.).</p>
</div>
<h2>Why I am taking this class</h2>
<div id = "boxRainbow" class = "boxRainbow">
	<img class = "image1" src="http://i.imgur.com/atunvqRt.png" alt="Creative Commons by https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/84/ca/1b/84ca1b0dcb2fccb2238669c50642a7ae.jpg , used under CC / resized from original">
	 <span class = "iceCreamRainbow">Work (forms, creating "classes" for users, reports, websites that link to all of these things)
	 <p>My own content (putting my own stuff on the web)</p>
	 <p>Contributing (If you need to do something, anything, on the web, google how to do it -someone else has already done it. What if you want to contribute something truly new?)</p>
	 <p>This is so fun.</p>
